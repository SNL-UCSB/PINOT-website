We require all holders of PINOT nodes to read and agree with this policy. 

Short version of the policy:
- We store information you provided and do not share it
- Please, let the node just work and do not explore it
- Please, return the node if you don't want to keep it anymore or if we asked to

In any case, please read the whole policy presented below.

# PINOT Node Holder Policy

## Identity information
To properly maintain the project's coverage, we are required to store your location information and preferred way to contact you. 
This information is available only to the project's team and under no condition (except legal obligations) is shared with other parties.

## Node information sharing
To provide project's transparency, we publicly share approximate nodes locations, together with their uptime and total traffic usage on both
wired and wireless interfaces. As a node holder, you are able to select a level of detalization for a location information.

## Termination and node return
If you no longer wish to participate in the project or if we decide to terminate the project,
you are required to return the PINOT node to us in a timely manner. 
We will provide you with instructions on how to return it to us.

## PINOT node security
As a PINOT node holder, you're required not to intervene into the node's work, including but not limited to:
- Node disassembling or physical modification
- Accessing the internal node structure
- Accessing the node's SD card or any information stored there

You are allowed to physically disconnect the node from the power source (turning it off) if it's required, but we'd
appreciate if you turn it on back as soon as possible, or notify us if it's not possible. If there are any problems or discomfort regarding the node 
(including noise, heat, or any other physical or psychological issues), we kindly ask you to notify us using the project's email
